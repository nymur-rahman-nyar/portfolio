                <h3>Native Android Application Development</h3>
                <p>Developed and published a native
                    Android app utilizing the Kotlin
                    programming language,
                    strategically chosen for its
                    proficiency. The app serves as an
                    innovative solution for a company,
                    replacing conventional hard
                    catalogs by dynamically
                    showcasing products to customers.
                    Proficiently demonstrated software
                    development principles, with a
                    deliberate decision to leverage the
                    Google platform to align with the
                    predominantly Android user base.</p>

                <p>Features of my application:</p>
                    <li>Categorized according to services / brands.</li>
                    <li>Search filter to search each product by name</li>
                    <li>Build in PDF viewer to view product documents in the product page.</li>

                <h3>Entrepreneurship , Web Design and Online Marketing</h3>
                <p>During the COVID period, my friend and I launched a project aimed at connecting students in Bangladesh with top local tutors through an online platform named Antojal. Though our initial plans did not pan out as hoped, the experience enriched my skills in numerous ways.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary Goal:</strong> Connect students with renowned tutors for quality education at home.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secondary Goal:</strong> Connect service providers and consumers online to reduce virus spread.</li>
                    <li><strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong> Introduction to Google marketing tools, video production for promotion on platforms like YouTube, and advanced website art design using Affinity Pro.</li>
